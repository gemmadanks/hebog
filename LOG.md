# Hebog execution log

This is the chronological execution record for the
[Hebog implementation plan](plans/source-finder-implementation.md). It records
material work, evidence, decisions, deviations, and immediate next steps; it
does not duplicate every commit.

Use the project records as follows:

- the implementation plan defines intended scope, phases, gates, risks, and
  remaining work;
- this log records what happened while executing that plan;
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains user-visible release changes managed by Release
  Please;
- architecture decision records under `docs/architecture/adr/` explain
  significant architectural choices;
- atomic Conventional Commits remain the detailed record of individual code
  changes: their subjects are written for user-facing release notes and their
  bodies provide developer context and validation;
- all agent-created commits remain local for human review and manual push.

Add entries in chronological order using ISO dates. Include commands, dataset
identifiers, revisions, and measured evidence when they affect a scientific or
performance conclusion. Do not add an entry for a routine implementation
commit that is fully explained by its subject and body. Update the plan only
when execution changes its scope, sequence, gates, risks, or decisions.

## Current position

Hebog has a validated package and development scaffold. Phase 0 records the
provisional Rapthor/PyBDSF contract, shared language, system boundaries,
scope/scheduling ADRs, and the initial governed synthetic-development data.
The scientific algorithms, frozen PyBDSF products, qualification datasets,
external-product comparison runner, and matched runtime baselines are not
implemented. The analytic catalogue, RMS-map, and mask comparison oracle is
now independently tested. ADR 005 requires out-of-core hierarchical tiling for
100,000-by-100,000 images and qualification across 100 to several hundred
Dask worker nodes. The next milestone is to resolve the exact runtime
revisions, reproduce both PyBDSF baselines, and freeze the large-image resource
and scaling gates before algorithm development begins.

## 2026-07-16 — Profiled the existing PyBDSF path

**Plan phase:** Pre-project investigation

**Completed**

- Profiled a representative 3000 by 3000 Rapthor image using adaptive RMS and
  three wavelet scales.
- Examined the existing PyBDSF and Rapthor execution model and identified
  background/RMS and repeated wavelet processing as the primary bottlenecks.
- Established that Gaussian fitting was not the first optimization target for
  this workload.

**Evidence**

| Measurement | Wall time |
| --- | ---: |
| PyBDSF true-sky pass, one core | 57.73 s |
| PyBDSF true-sky pass, four cores | 35.29 s |
| Flat-noise RMS pass, four cores | 9.55 s |
| Controlled interpolation experiment | 22.25 s |

Background/RMS estimation took 10.41 seconds and wavelet processing took
22.53 seconds in the normal four-core pass, together accounting for 95.4% of
measured operation time. Gaussian fitting took 0.07 seconds. These exploratory
measurements still require reproduction in Phase 0 before they become release
evidence.

**Decisions**

- Build a narrower Rapthor-focused source finder instead of reproducing every
  PyBDSF feature.
- Keep orchestration in Python and use NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and compiled or
  GIL-releasing kernels for array-intensive work.
- Let Rapthor own the top-level Dask graph and submit coarse tasks rather than
  distributing every pixel, window, or island.
- Target at least a 50% reduction in matched median `filter_skymodel` wall
  time, subject to scientific-equivalence and memory gates.

**Plan impact**

- The profiling evidence became the motivation, provisional budgets, and
  phase ordering in the implementation plan.

**Next**

- Create a dedicated source-finder project and preserve the evidence in a
  reproducible Phase 0 harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Bootstrapped the Hebog repository

**Plan phase:** Repository preparation

**Commits**

- `fa252e9` — initial commit
- `e79262a` — rename the distributable package to `hebog`
- `4f69c30` — initialize version `0.1.0`

**Completed**

- Replaced the template package name throughout the repository with `hebog`.
- Set the initial project and release metadata version to `0.1.0`.
- Set Release Please's bootstrap SHA to the full initial commit
  `fa252e9ec4f81aa05238fad7f40358426012f671`.

**Decisions**

- Use `hebog` for the repository, distribution, import package, and CLI.
- Incubate the experimental project independently while keeping its package,
  interfaces, tests, and build workflow portable.

**Evidence**

- Both the `hebog` console command and `python -m hebog` reported version
  `0.1.0` after the package scaffold was completed.

**Next**

- Port the useful source-finder planning and scaffold into Hebog without
  retaining a second, incompatible toolchain.

## 2026-07-18 — Ported and adapted the source-finder scaffold

**Plan phase:** Repository preparation

**Commit:** `4e7a7b9` — add initial project scaffolding

**Completed**

- Ported the useful planning, architectural constraints, test layout, data
  models, executor interfaces, CLI, documentation, configuration, and
  benchmark scaffold from the local prototype.
- Adapted the predecessor's conventions to Hebog's
  existing uv, just, GitHub Actions, Release Please, and MkDocs workflow.
- Added scheduler-independent requests and results, serial and existing-client
  Dask executors, public configuration, and an intentionally unimplemented
  pipeline boundary.
- Added unit, integration, scientific-equivalence, and benchmark test lanes.
- Replaced the remaining interactive example with a Marimo Python notebook and
  removed Jupyter, IPython, `nbmake`, `nbstripout`, editor integration, ignore
  rules, documentation, and locked dependencies.
- Added the durable source-finder implementation plan containing scientific
  gates, dataset coverage, phases, performance budgets, benchmark protocol,
  risks, and definition of done.

**Decisions**

- Scientific equivalence means matching the behaviour Rapthor consumes, not
  bitwise equality with PyBDSF.
- Public records remain small, materialised, and serializable; they do not
  contain open FITS files, scheduler clients, or mutable full-image objects.
- PyBDSF implementation code will not be copied or mechanically translated.
- Marimo is the only notebook workflow.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed.
- Six implemented tests passed and the two Phase 0 placeholder suites skipped.
- Coverage was 81% for the initial scaffold.
- Ruff, Pyright, pre-commit, strict Marimo validation, strict MkDocs, uv lock
  validation, and the isolated `hebog==0.1.0` wheel smoke test passed.

**Plan impact**

- `plans/source-finder-implementation.md` became the authoritative technical
  roadmap.
- Phase 0 was established as a hard prerequisite for algorithm work.

**Next**

- Review the testing approach before implementing comparison or scientific
  kernels.

## 2026-07-18 — Established the test-first execution strategy

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 preparation

**Commit:** `85234e6` — follow test-first strategy

**Completed**

- Added an explicit red-green-refactor workflow to every implementation phase.
- Defined the oracle hierarchy: analytic truth, mathematical and metamorphic
  properties, the Hebog serial reference, frozen PyBDSF compatibility products,
  and end-to-end Rapthor decisions.
- Split datasets into development, regression, and held-out qualification
  roles to reduce tuning against the final validation matrix.
- Defined unit/property, contract, integration, small-equivalence, acceptance,
  qualification, and benchmark lanes.
- Added strict pytest markers and separated portable CI from controlled
  qualification and wall-time testing.
- Added Hypothesis and initial property-based configuration tests.
- Added acceptance, equivalence-reference, and test-data governance
  scaffolding and documentation.

**Decisions**

- Use TDD by default for public contracts, pure scientific kernels, schemas,
  matching, error behaviour, and executor semantics.
- Use lightweight Given/When/Then pytest scenarios for Rapthor-facing
  behaviour.
- Do not add a Gherkin framework unless domain experts will actively review or
  author feature files.
- Keep qualification results out of routine development and enforce
  performance gates only on controlled runners.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed.
- Eight portable unit and integration tests passed with 81% scaffold coverage.
- Small equivalence and acceptance scaffolds selected and skipped as intended.
- `just test-qualification` selected the held-out qualification scaffold and
  skipped because Phase 0 data is not yet available.
- Ruff, Pyright, pre-commit, strict Marimo validation, strict MkDocs, uv lock
  validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test passed.

**Plan impact**

- The plan gained a testing strategy, independent oracle validation, dataset
  roles, BDD guidance, deterministic distributed-testing rules, and test-first
  tasks in every delivery phase.

**Next**

- Inventory the exact PyBDSF catalogue, RMS, mask, failure, and empty-result
  contracts used by LSMTool and Rapthor.
- Freeze development, regression, and qualification manifests.
- Write failing analytic tests for catalogue matching and RMS/mask comparison
  before implementing the Phase 0 comparison harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Adopted an incremental release strategy

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting delivery policy

**Completed**

- Added a release strategy that permits coherent, tested vertical slices to be
  released before an entire delivery phase is complete.
- Added indicative `0.1.x` through `0.9.x` capability bands and defined the
  qualification required for `1.0.0`.
- Added release evidence requirements covering portable CI, relevant
  scientific suites, documentation, schemas, migration notes, and performance
  claims.
- Replaced the stale Phase 8 instruction to release `0.1` in the future; the
  repository is already versioned `0.1.0`.

**Decisions**

- Keep all pre-production releases experimental in the `0.x` series.
- Treat phase exit gates as readiness gates for dependent work rather than as
  release gates.
- Let Release Please and Conventional Commits determine actual versions; do
  not force phase numbers and release versions to match.
- Permit documented breaking changes before 1.0 while keeping public schemas
  explicitly versioned.
- Reserve `1.0.0` and Rapthor default cutover for the complete definition of
  done, scientific approval, and operational soak.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed after the plan and log changes.

**Plan impact**

- Frequent releases can now communicate incremental capability without
  weakening scientific, performance, or production-readiness gates.

**Next**

- Use the `0.2.x` capability band as guidance for the first Phase 0 vertical
  slices, without treating it as a fixed phase-version contract.

## 2026-07-18 — Planned domain language and architecture records

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 preparation

**Completed**

- Added a provisional domain glossary and explicit naming conventions to the
  Phase 0 deliverables.
- Added a domain model with code-native system-context and processing/data-flow
  diagrams, while deferring unstable executor detail.
- Added ADR tasks for Hebog's narrow Rapthor scope, external scheduler
  ownership, and the compatibility-schema boundary.
- Added domain-review requirements to the Phase 0 exit gate and terminology
  and diagram-maintenance risks to the plan.

**Decisions**

- Treat the glossary and diagrams as testable architectural documentation that
  is reviewed with the Phase 0 contracts, not as speculative upfront design.
- Record the already-settled scope and scheduler boundaries in ADRs 003 and
  004 before implementing them.
- Defer ADR 005 until the compatibility inventory supplies evidence, and write
  algorithm ADRs only when tests and benchmarks expose consequential choices.
- Use Mermaid for diagrams so they remain reviewable beside the documentation.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed after the plan and log changes: eight portable tests passed,
  the equivalence and acceptance scaffolds skipped as intended, and linting,
  type checking, strict Marimo validation, strict documentation, lockfile
  validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test succeeded.

**Plan impact**

- Phase 0 now freezes shared vocabulary and architectural boundaries as well as
  scientific contracts, datasets, comparison oracles, and baselines.
- The definition of done now requires the glossary and diagrams to match the
  released architecture and separate compatibility names from internal terms.

**Next**

- Begin Phase 0 by inventorying the PyBDSF, LSMTool, and Rapthor contracts and
  terminology, then draft the glossary, domain model, and ADRs 003 and 004.

## 2026-07-18 — Captured the first Phase 0 contract slice

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 — freeze baselines and contracts

**Completed**

- Traced the source-finding inputs, defaults, products, catalogue fields,
  empty behaviour, downstream diagnostics, and task boundary consumed by
  Rapthor.
- Added a machine-readable candidate inventory of repository revisions,
  dependency-definition hashes, and container-definition hashes.
- Added the provisional domain glossary, naming conventions, system-context
  diagram, and processing/data-flow diagram.
- Accepted ADR 003 limiting Hebog to Rapthor's source-finding contract and ADR
  004 retaining top-level scheduler ownership in Rapthor.

**Evidence**

- Rapthor was traced at
  `b1a64674b1022476cf052fc2d06ee3b16f031ecd` on the
  `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch.
- The local PyBDSF reference was
  `c70103be3ae9ae9908286f144e6ce956acc0ce5c`; the local LSMTool reference was
  `4e5cf93046e309844c04382375f86e68929bd2d8` with two untracked files.
- Rapthor's pinned LSMTool commit
  `3adf3d6f1f8c03db34e13a45a752f6f6dd7d7f4a` was available after refreshing
  the checkout, and its source-finding module matched the checked-out module.
- Rapthor directly consumes `Source_id`, `RA`, `DEC`, `Isl_Total_flux`,
  `Total_flux`, `DC_Maj`, `E_RA`, and `E_DEC`, plus true-sky/flat-noise RMS
  images, the island mask, filtered sky models, and source-count diagnostics.
- `just ci` passed: eight portable tests passed, equivalence and acceptance
  scaffolds skipped as intended, and linting, type checking, strict Marimo and
  MkDocs validation, lockfile validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test
  succeeded.

**Decisions**

- Treat the Rapthor source-finding contract, rather than the complete PyBDSF
  feature set, as Hebog's initial compatibility surface.
- Keep PyBDSF objects and terminology outside Hebog's scientific kernels;
  preserve external names only at a compatibility boundary.
- Treat Rapthor's `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch as the authoritative
  integration target because it owns the Prefect/Dask task runner.
- Keep the revision inventory in candidate status until it records the exact
  installed PyBDSF/LSMTool packages and an immutable built-container digest.

**Deviations and gaps**

- Rapthor declares `bdsf` without a version or revision.
- The refreshed PyBDSF checkout contains changes to island, RMS, and output
  behaviour, so its revision cannot substitute for the still-unknown package
  installed in the benchmark runtime.
- The inspected container definitions use mutable base-image tags; no built
  benchmark-container digest was available.
- The Phase 0 revision-capture task therefore remains open.

**Plan impact**

- Completed the contract inventory, provisional glossary, domain diagrams,
  and ADR 003/004 tasks.
- Kept domain review, frozen examples, contract tests, exact runtime capture,
  comparison oracles, datasets, and baseline reproduction open.

**Next**

- Capture installed package versions and the benchmark-container digest from
  the controlled Rapthor environment.
- Reproduce the representative PyBDSF timings and current matched
  `filter_skymodel` median before implementing the comparison harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Excluded the preliminary scaffold from project evidence

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting scope clarification

**Completed**

- Removed `ska-sdp-source-finder` from the Phase 0 starting-revision inventory.
- Clarified that the implementation plan is owned by Hebog and must be
  justified against current consumer, dependency, and reference behaviour.

**Decision**

- Do not use the preliminary `ska-sdp-source-finder` scaffold or plan as a
  source of requirements, compatibility evidence, or migration constraints.
- Treat Rapthor's `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch, its pinned LSMTool
  code, and the applicable PyBDSF implementation and runtime as the
  authoritative technical sources.

This clarification supersedes any earlier implication that the preliminary
repository is a continuing project input. Work already adopted into Hebog
must stand on its current tests, documentation, decisions, and authoritative
source evidence.

## 2026-07-18 — Required released and master PyBDSF baselines

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 — freeze baselines and contracts

**Completed**

- Identified released PyBDSF `v1.14.1` at
  `1b6e0a04ba6327bc1ce3f576928fe58b81d8c1cc` as the current Rapthor
  comparator.
- Identified the refreshed performance-improved PyBDSF `master` reference at
  `c70103be3ae9ae9908286f144e6ce956acc0ce5c`, 40 commits after `v1.14.1`.
- Updated the plan, project guidance, and candidate revision inventory to
  require separate scientific and performance comparisons for both exact
  references.

**Decisions**

- Retain the original target of at least a 50% reduction in matched median
  `filter_skymodel` wall time relative to the released PyBDSF version used by
  Rapthor.
- Also require Hebog to be faster than the pinned PyBDSF `master` reference;
  the upper bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the median
  runtime ratio must be below `1.00`.
- Use released PyBDSF as the current compatibility reference. Treat `master`
  as forward-looking comparison evidence; adjudicate scientific differences
  using independent truth and the Rapthor contract.
- Pin both references for every benchmark record. Refresh `master`
  deliberately at qualification milestones without replacing historical
  results.

**Evidence**

- The local PyBDSF tag `v1.14.1` resolves to
  `1b6e0a04ba6327bc1ce3f576928fe58b81d8c1cc`.
- PyPI identifies `1.14.1` as the latest release at the capture date, publishes
  source provenance for the same commit, and reports source-distribution
  SHA-256
  `8d5113fecca19bb9f02a1a3e17aeb8f2d22c712cac9504e44271c4071f5434d2`.
- The range from `v1.14.1` to the recorded `master` includes an explicit
  residual-statistics speedup and RMS/adaptive-RMS simplifications, alongside
  scientific fixes affecting masks, fitting, fluxes, and outputs.

**Next**

- Confirm the installed released PyBDSF version inside the controlled Rapthor
  benchmark environment.
- Build isolated, matched environments and reproduce the same operation and
  complete `filter_skymodel` benchmark matrix for both PyBDSF references.

## 2026-07-18 — Made large-image scalability a core requirement

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting architecture and qualification

**Completed**

- Added the 100,000-by-100,000-pixel target and 100-to-several-hundred-node
  Dask deployment to Hebog's scope, Phase 0 contract, delivery phases, risks,
  release milestones, and definition of done.
- Recorded that production nodes are expected to provide hundreds of GB of
  RAM and made tile batching and caches resource-aware rather than fixed-size.
- Accepted ADR 005, selecting bounded haloed tiles, deterministic ownership,
  boundary summaries, and hierarchical reconciliation for image-sized work.
- Required partition-invariance tests for tile edges and corners, tile shape,
  partition origin, worker topology, task order, and retry.
- Defined the large-image scientific oracle as generated truth, global
  invariants, partition invariance, and PyBDSF-comparable cut-outs rather than
  requiring PyBDSF itself to process the full 100,000-by-100,000 image.
- Added a dedicated `scalability` pytest marker, `just test-scalability` lane,
  and a skipped Phase 0 harness placeholder for controlled multi-node runs.
- Renumbered the planned compatibility-schema decision to ADR 006.

**Decisions**

- Treat a small image as one tile using the same scientific ownership and
  reconciliation semantics as a distributed image; do not develop a
  whole-image-only scientific path first.
- Keep worker memory proportional to a tile core, its stage-specific halo, and
  bounded work buffers. No worker, scheduler payload, or public record may
  require a complete large plane.
- Keep Dask graph size proportional to tiles and stages, not pixels, RMS
  windows, or small islands. Use mergeable boundary summaries and tree
  reductions instead of central image-sized gathers.
- Use admitted worker memory to exploit memory-rich nodes while reserving
  headroom for concurrent Rapthor work. Resource sizing may change batching
  and caching, but never scientific ownership or results.
- Reuse Rapthor's existing Dask cluster and resource budget in accordance with
  ADR 004; Hebog may construct a bounded operation subgraph but does not own a
  private cluster.
- Leave the physical chunk store and distributed output format open until
  Phase 0/1 I/O and restart benchmarks provide evidence.

**Evidence**

- A 100,000-by-100,000 image contains 10 billion pixels. One plane is 40 GB at
  `float32` or 80 GB at `float64`, before RMS, normalized, mask, multiscale,
  residual, and work arrays.
- Multiple simultaneously useful planes and work buffers can exceed one
  memory-rich node even when it has hundreds of GB of RAM, so distributed
  bounded-memory execution remains necessary.
- `just test-scalability`, `just test-benchmark`, and
  `just test-qualification` each selected only their intended scaffold and
  skipped pending Phase 0 data or infrastructure.
- `just ci` passed: eight portable tests passed; equivalence and acceptance
  scaffolds skipped as intended; and linting, type checking, strict Marimo and
  MkDocs validation, lock validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test
  succeeded.

**Plan impact**

- Phase 0 must freeze the input/output plane set, storage target, tile/halo
  constraints, per-worker memory ceiling, runtime, scheduler-overhead, and
  strong/weak-scaling efficiency gates.
- Phase 6 must qualify the 100,000-by-100,000 case at 100 and at least 200
  worker nodes and record the complete 1/10/50/100/200-plus-node matrix where
  the approved facility provides it.

**Next**

- Identify the representative large-image storage and Dask facility, then
  agree the provisional resource and scaling SLOs.
- Add analytic partition-manifest, halo, ownership, and boundary-reconciliation
  tests before implementing image I/O or scientific kernels.

## 2026-07-18 — Made performance goals size-stratified

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting performance contract

**Completed**

- Reframed the 50% improvement over released PyBDSF and the pinned `master`
  comparison as minimum release gates rather than an optimization endpoint.
- Added a logarithmic 256-to-100,000-pixel performance matrix with sparse,
  normal, and dense or extended workloads at every representative size.
- Required benchmark cases on both sides of executor, storage, partition, and
  batching crossovers instead of hard-coding one image-size threshold.
- Added a previous-Hebog performance curve and a confidence-based rule for
  reviewing supported-size regressions greater than 5%.
- Updated architecture and contributor guidance so small inputs use the
  lowest-overhead one-tile path and acquire chunking or Dask overhead only
  when complete-runtime measurements justify it.

**Decisions**

- Optimize complete end-to-end latency and useful throughput across all
  supported sizes; do not trade small-input latency for large-image throughput
  silently, or vice versa.
- Treat 256, 512, 1,024, 3,000, 8,000, 10,000, 30,000, and 100,000 pixels per
  side as benchmark anchors, not permanent execution thresholds.
- Use image planes, halos, source density, storage, admitted CPU and RAM, and
  measured overhead to select the lowest-cost valid plan within the executor
  supplied by the caller.

**Evidence**

- `just check` and `just docs-build` passed.
- `just ci` passed: all push-stage hooks succeeded; eight portable tests
  passed; equivalence and acceptance scaffolds skipped as intended; and strict
  Marimo and MkDocs validation, lock validation, and the isolated wheel smoke
  test succeeded.

**Next**

- During Phase 0, reproduce both PyBDSF references and establish the initial
  Hebog performance curve at every runnable size.
- Freeze one-tile overhead budgets and the first measured serial, local, Dask,
  storage, partition, and batching crossover cases.

## 2026-07-18 — Made maintainability and reuse explicit quality gates

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting architecture and engineering quality

**Completed**

- Defined maintainability, extensibility, interoperability, testability, and
  performance transparency as release qualities alongside scientific
  correctness, speed, and scalability.
- Clarified ADR 003: Rapthor defines the first qualified feature slice but is
  not a dependency of Hebog's scientific core; other pipelines and science
  workflows use the public API through their own orchestration and adapters.
- Added Pythonic clean-code guidance, inward dependency rules, code-review
  checks, and a dedicated quality-attributes documentation page.
- Expanded Ruff to enforce Bugbear, comprehension, complexity, naming,
  performance-idiom, simplification, unused-argument, and Ruff-specific rules
  in addition to the existing formatting, import, and Pylint checks.
- Enabled strict Pyright checking across `src/` and `tests/` and added an 80%
  branch-aware coverage floor.
- Added an architecture test that prevents algorithms and domain records from
  importing adapters, I/O, executors, workflow frameworks, or concrete
  schedulers.

**Decisions**

- Keep the qualified scope Rapthor-focused while making the scientific API,
  domain records, configuration, and algorithms pipeline-neutral.
- Introduce narrow protocols only at demonstrated variation points. Do not add
  a generic plugin framework, registry, or service locator in anticipation of
  unknown consumers.
- Isolate profiled low-level optimization behind small typed functions and
  retain a readable deterministic serial oracle.
- Require a documented non-Rapthor workflow through the public API before
  `1.0.0` as evidence that reuse works through supported boundaries.

**Evidence**

- The focused architecture and Dask executor tests passed: three tests.
- The expanded Ruff rules and strict Pyright passed with zero diagnostics.
- `just coverage` passed with ten portable tests and 81.03% branch-aware
  coverage against the new 80% floor; `just docs-build` passed strictly.
- `just ci` passed: all push-stage hooks, strict typing and documentation,
  portable coverage tests, lock validation, Marimo validation, and isolated
  wheel build/install/import succeeded; equivalence and acceptance scaffolds
  skipped as intended.

**Next**

- Add import-time side-effect checks as the I/O and orchestration boundaries
  are implemented.
- Define image-source and product-sink seams from concrete FITS and alternate
  workflow tests rather than designing them speculatively.

## 2026-07-18 — Assessed Rust and C++ native acceleration

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting performance and maintainability architecture

**Completed**

- Assessed whether project-owned Rust or C++ would improve Hebog after
  accounting for NumPy/SciPy compiled kernels, Numba, end-to-end bottlenecks,
  Dask thread ownership, array-copy costs, and the supported wheel matrix.
- Documented candidate kernels, non-candidates, Rust/PyO3 and C++/pybind11
  trade-offs, FFI requirements, packaging implications, and primary sources.
- Added a quantitative reconsideration gate and conditional native-code tasks,
  risks, release requirements, review checks, and definition-of-done criteria.

**Decisions**

- Do not add a Hebog C++ or Rust extension before scientific kernels and
  representative end-to-end profiles exist. Use vectorized NumPy/SciPy first,
  then a reviewed Numba implementation for material custom loops.
- Consider a native prototype only when a self-contained kernel remains at
  least 10% of complete time in two size regimes, blocks a frozen resource or
  scale gate, or already exists as a mature reviewed native library.
- Require at least a 2x kernel speedup and a statistically supported 5%
  end-to-end improvement unless the extension instead unlocks a failed memory
  or scalability gate.
- Prefer Rust for a new self-contained kernel because memory and thread safety
  support maintainability. Prefer C++ when reusing a mature C/C++ library or
  when ecosystem or team evidence makes it lower risk.
- Require an accepted ADR, coarse zero-copy-capable array boundary, explicit
  interpreter and thread handling, safety tests, scientific parity, and the
  complete supported binary-wheel matrix before production use.

**Evidence**

- `just check` passed with nine quick tests; `just docs-build` passed strictly.
- `just ci` passed: all push-stage hooks, strict typing and documentation,
  ten portable coverage tests at 81.03%, lock and Marimo validation, and the
  isolated universal wheel build/install/import succeeded; equivalence and
  acceptance scaffolds skipped as intended.

**Next**

- Profile each implemented phase before considering a native spike; record
  array copies, memory bandwidth, I/O, scheduling, and kernel time separately.
- If a kernel passes the decision gate, benchmark the smallest Rust and/or C++
  prototype against the same Python/Numba contract before choosing a language.

## 2026-07-18 — Established deterministic validation data

**Plan phase:** Phase 0

**Completed**

- Added a strict versioned manifest for two analytic and seeded development
  datasets with explicit roles, provenance, redistribution status, beam/WCS
  metadata, expected statistics, complete recipes, and canonical SHA-256
  recipe digests.
- Added an in-memory generator for bounded analytic tests and a
  window-addressable generator for large logical planes.
- Derived random noise from global pixel addresses so generation is exactly
  invariant to window layout, call order, and worker assignment.
- Added validation for duplicate identifiers, stale recipe digests, invalid
  WCS/beam/source geometry, inconsistent statistics, and accidental unbounded
  complete-plane allocations.

**Decisions**

- Treat a generator version and complete canonical recipe as provenance; a
  random seed alone is insufficient.
- Keep the initial checked-in datasets in the `development` role. Do not claim
  frozen regression, qualification, or PyBDSF reference products until their
  manifests and scientific review are complete.
- Generate the future 100,000-by-100,000 cases through bounded windows and
  external materialised storage, never one NumPy allocation or a Git artifact.

**Evidence**

- Twelve analytic tests passed, including exact whole-plane versus stitched-
  window equality, seed repeatability, analytic source amplitude, checksum
  enforcement, role completeness, and allocation safety.
- Focused Ruff and strict Pyright checks passed with no diagnostics.

**Next**

- Implement and analytically prove the catalogue, RMS-map, and mask comparison
  reports before comparing frozen external products.
- Define the large performance/scalability recipes, assign reviewed regression
  and qualification roles, and capture immutable products from both exact
  PyBDSF references.

## 2026-07-18 — Proved the scientific comparison oracle

**Plan phase:** Phase 0

**Completed**

- Implemented canonical catalogue records with explicit angular and flux
  units, great-circle coordinate separation, right-ascension wraparound, and a
  global one-to-one assignment.
- Defined a deterministic assignment objective that maximizes valid match
  count, then total matched integrated flux, then angular proximity.
- Added catalogue reports for unmatched rows, completeness, reliability,
  beam-normalized position differences, and peak/integrated flux differences.
- Added RMS-map reports with explicit masking, non-finite and zero-reference
  exclusions, plus boolean-mask confusion and agreement reports.

**Decisions**

- Keep the oracle independent of Hebog algorithms and PyBDSF readers so an
  adapter defect cannot redefine scientific equivalence.
- Use explicit empty-set semantics and `None` for unavailable numerical
  metrics; never manufacture a denominator epsilon or allow array
  broadcasting.
- Keep this first matcher one-to-one. Source/component grouping requires an
  independently tested compatibility adapter rather than duplicated rows.

**Evidence**

- Seventeen analytic tests passed for unit conversion, spherical coordinates,
  ambiguous assignments, unmatched and empty catalogues, flux/report metrics,
  masks, RMS exclusions, and invalid inputs.
- Focused Ruff and strict Pyright checks passed with no diagnostics.

**Next**

- Add the machine-readable external-product runner and immutable outputs from
  released PyBDSF and pinned `master`, then apply these reports to both.
- Stratify catalogue metrics by compact, blended, extended, edge, and SNR
  classes after the reference schemas and qualification manifest are frozen.
