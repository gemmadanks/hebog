# Hebog execution log

This is the chronological execution record for the
[Hebog implementation plan](plans/source-finder-implementation.md). It records
material work, evidence, decisions, deviations, and immediate next steps; it
does not duplicate every commit.

Use the project records as follows:

- the implementation plan defines intended scope, phases, gates, risks, and
  remaining work;
- this log records what happened while executing that plan;
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains user-visible release changes managed by Release
  Please;
- architecture decision records under `docs/architecture/adr/` explain
  significant architectural choices;
- atomic Conventional Commits remain the detailed record of individual code
  changes: their subjects are written for user-facing release notes and their
  bodies provide developer context and validation;
- all agent-created commits remain local for human review and manual push.

Add entries in chronological order using ISO dates. Include commands, dataset
identifiers, revisions, and measured evidence when they affect a scientific or
performance conclusion. Do not add an entry for a routine implementation
commit that is fully explained by its subject and body. Update the plan only
when execution changes its scope, sequence, gates, risks, or decisions.

## Current position

Hebog has a validated package and development scaffold. The first Phase 0
slice records the provisional Rapthor/PyBDSF contract, shared language, system
boundaries, and scope/scheduling ADRs. The scientific algorithms, frozen
datasets, comparison harness, and matched runtime baseline are not implemented.
The next milestone is to resolve the exact runtime revisions and reproduce the
matched PyBDSF baseline before algorithm development begins.

## 2026-07-16 — Profiled the existing PyBDSF path

**Plan phase:** Pre-project investigation

**Completed**

- Profiled a representative 3000 by 3000 Rapthor image using adaptive RMS and
  three wavelet scales.
- Examined the existing PyBDSF and Rapthor execution model and identified
  background/RMS and repeated wavelet processing as the primary bottlenecks.
- Established that Gaussian fitting was not the first optimization target for
  this workload.

**Evidence**

| Measurement | Wall time |
| --- | ---: |
| PyBDSF true-sky pass, one core | 57.73 s |
| PyBDSF true-sky pass, four cores | 35.29 s |
| Flat-noise RMS pass, four cores | 9.55 s |
| Controlled interpolation experiment | 22.25 s |

Background/RMS estimation took 10.41 seconds and wavelet processing took
22.53 seconds in the normal four-core pass, together accounting for 95.4% of
measured operation time. Gaussian fitting took 0.07 seconds. These exploratory
measurements still require reproduction in Phase 0 before they become release
evidence.

**Decisions**

- Build a narrower Rapthor-focused source finder instead of reproducing every
  PyBDSF feature.
- Keep orchestration in Python and use NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and compiled or
  GIL-releasing kernels for array-intensive work.
- Let Rapthor own the top-level Dask graph and submit coarse tasks rather than
  distributing every pixel, window, or island.
- Target at least a 50% reduction in matched median `filter_skymodel` wall
  time, subject to scientific-equivalence and memory gates.

**Plan impact**

- The profiling evidence became the motivation, provisional budgets, and
  phase ordering in the implementation plan.

**Next**

- Create a dedicated source-finder project and preserve the evidence in a
  reproducible Phase 0 harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Bootstrapped the Hebog repository

**Plan phase:** Repository preparation

**Commits**

- `fa252e9` — initial commit
- `e79262a` — rename the distributable package to `hebog`
- `4f69c30` — initialize version `0.1.0`

**Completed**

- Replaced the template package name throughout the repository with `hebog`.
- Set the initial project and release metadata version to `0.1.0`.
- Set Release Please's bootstrap SHA to the full initial commit
  `fa252e9ec4f81aa05238fad7f40358426012f671`.

**Decisions**

- Use `hebog` for the repository, distribution, import package, and CLI.
- Incubate the experimental project independently while keeping its package,
  interfaces, tests, and build workflow portable.

**Evidence**

- Both the `hebog` console command and `python -m hebog` reported version
  `0.1.0` after the package scaffold was completed.

**Next**

- Port the useful source-finder planning and scaffold into Hebog without
  retaining a second, incompatible toolchain.

## 2026-07-18 — Ported and adapted the source-finder scaffold

**Plan phase:** Repository preparation

**Commit:** `4e7a7b9` — add initial project scaffolding

**Completed**

- Ported the useful planning, architectural constraints, test layout, data
  models, executor interfaces, CLI, documentation, configuration, and
  benchmark scaffold from the local prototype.
- Adapted the predecessor's conventions to Hebog's
  existing uv, just, GitHub Actions, Release Please, and MkDocs workflow.
- Added scheduler-independent requests and results, serial and existing-client
  Dask executors, public configuration, and an intentionally unimplemented
  pipeline boundary.
- Added unit, integration, scientific-equivalence, and benchmark test lanes.
- Replaced the remaining interactive example with a Marimo Python notebook and
  removed Jupyter, IPython, `nbmake`, `nbstripout`, editor integration, ignore
  rules, documentation, and locked dependencies.
- Added the durable source-finder implementation plan containing scientific
  gates, dataset coverage, phases, performance budgets, benchmark protocol,
  risks, and definition of done.

**Decisions**

- Scientific equivalence means matching the behaviour Rapthor consumes, not
  bitwise equality with PyBDSF.
- Public records remain small, materialised, and serializable; they do not
  contain open FITS files, scheduler clients, or mutable full-image objects.
- PyBDSF implementation code will not be copied or mechanically translated.
- Marimo is the only notebook workflow.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed.
- Six implemented tests passed and the two Phase 0 placeholder suites skipped.
- Coverage was 81% for the initial scaffold.
- Ruff, Pyright, pre-commit, strict Marimo validation, strict MkDocs, uv lock
  validation, and the isolated `hebog==0.1.0` wheel smoke test passed.

**Plan impact**

- `plans/source-finder-implementation.md` became the authoritative technical
  roadmap.
- Phase 0 was established as a hard prerequisite for algorithm work.

**Next**

- Review the testing approach before implementing comparison or scientific
  kernels.

## 2026-07-18 — Established the test-first execution strategy

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 preparation

**Commit:** `85234e6` — follow test-first strategy

**Completed**

- Added an explicit red-green-refactor workflow to every implementation phase.
- Defined the oracle hierarchy: analytic truth, mathematical and metamorphic
  properties, the Hebog serial reference, frozen PyBDSF compatibility products,
  and end-to-end Rapthor decisions.
- Split datasets into development, regression, and held-out qualification
  roles to reduce tuning against the final validation matrix.
- Defined unit/property, contract, integration, small-equivalence, acceptance,
  qualification, and benchmark lanes.
- Added strict pytest markers and separated portable CI from controlled
  qualification and wall-time testing.
- Added Hypothesis and initial property-based configuration tests.
- Added acceptance, equivalence-reference, and test-data governance
  scaffolding and documentation.

**Decisions**

- Use TDD by default for public contracts, pure scientific kernels, schemas,
  matching, error behaviour, and executor semantics.
- Use lightweight Given/When/Then pytest scenarios for Rapthor-facing
  behaviour.
- Do not add a Gherkin framework unless domain experts will actively review or
  author feature files.
- Keep qualification results out of routine development and enforce
  performance gates only on controlled runners.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed.
- Eight portable unit and integration tests passed with 81% scaffold coverage.
- Small equivalence and acceptance scaffolds selected and skipped as intended.
- `just test-qualification` selected the held-out qualification scaffold and
  skipped because Phase 0 data is not yet available.
- Ruff, Pyright, pre-commit, strict Marimo validation, strict MkDocs, uv lock
  validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test passed.

**Plan impact**

- The plan gained a testing strategy, independent oracle validation, dataset
  roles, BDD guidance, deterministic distributed-testing rules, and test-first
  tasks in every delivery phase.

**Next**

- Inventory the exact PyBDSF catalogue, RMS, mask, failure, and empty-result
  contracts used by LSMTool and Rapthor.
- Freeze development, regression, and qualification manifests.
- Write failing analytic tests for catalogue matching and RMS/mask comparison
  before implementing the Phase 0 comparison harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Adopted an incremental release strategy

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting delivery policy

**Completed**

- Added a release strategy that permits coherent, tested vertical slices to be
  released before an entire delivery phase is complete.
- Added indicative `0.1.x` through `0.9.x` capability bands and defined the
  qualification required for `1.0.0`.
- Added release evidence requirements covering portable CI, relevant
  scientific suites, documentation, schemas, migration notes, and performance
  claims.
- Replaced the stale Phase 8 instruction to release `0.1` in the future; the
  repository is already versioned `0.1.0`.

**Decisions**

- Keep all pre-production releases experimental in the `0.x` series.
- Treat phase exit gates as readiness gates for dependent work rather than as
  release gates.
- Let Release Please and Conventional Commits determine actual versions; do
  not force phase numbers and release versions to match.
- Permit documented breaking changes before 1.0 while keeping public schemas
  explicitly versioned.
- Reserve `1.0.0` and Rapthor default cutover for the complete definition of
  done, scientific approval, and operational soak.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed after the plan and log changes.

**Plan impact**

- Frequent releases can now communicate incremental capability without
  weakening scientific, performance, or production-readiness gates.

**Next**

- Use the `0.2.x` capability band as guidance for the first Phase 0 vertical
  slices, without treating it as a fixed phase-version contract.

## 2026-07-18 — Planned domain language and architecture records

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 preparation

**Completed**

- Added a provisional domain glossary and explicit naming conventions to the
  Phase 0 deliverables.
- Added a domain model with code-native system-context and processing/data-flow
  diagrams, while deferring unstable executor detail.
- Added ADR tasks for Hebog's narrow Rapthor scope, external scheduler
  ownership, and the compatibility-schema boundary.
- Added domain-review requirements to the Phase 0 exit gate and terminology
  and diagram-maintenance risks to the plan.

**Decisions**

- Treat the glossary and diagrams as testable architectural documentation that
  is reviewed with the Phase 0 contracts, not as speculative upfront design.
- Record the already-settled scope and scheduler boundaries in ADRs 003 and
  004 before implementing them.
- Defer ADR 005 until the compatibility inventory supplies evidence, and write
  algorithm ADRs only when tests and benchmarks expose consequential choices.
- Use Mermaid for diagrams so they remain reviewable beside the documentation.

**Evidence**

- `just ci` passed after the plan and log changes: eight portable tests passed,
  the equivalence and acceptance scaffolds skipped as intended, and linting,
  type checking, strict Marimo validation, strict documentation, lockfile
  validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test succeeded.

**Plan impact**

- Phase 0 now freezes shared vocabulary and architectural boundaries as well as
  scientific contracts, datasets, comparison oracles, and baselines.
- The definition of done now requires the glossary and diagrams to match the
  released architecture and separate compatibility names from internal terms.

**Next**

- Begin Phase 0 by inventorying the PyBDSF, LSMTool, and Rapthor contracts and
  terminology, then draft the glossary, domain model, and ADRs 003 and 004.

## 2026-07-18 — Captured the first Phase 0 contract slice

**Plan phase:** Phase 0 — freeze baselines and contracts

**Completed**

- Traced the source-finding inputs, defaults, products, catalogue fields,
  empty behaviour, downstream diagnostics, and task boundary consumed by
  Rapthor.
- Added a machine-readable candidate inventory of repository revisions,
  dependency-definition hashes, and container-definition hashes.
- Added the provisional domain glossary, naming conventions, system-context
  diagram, and processing/data-flow diagram.
- Accepted ADR 003 limiting Hebog to Rapthor's source-finding contract and ADR
  004 retaining top-level scheduler ownership in Rapthor.

**Evidence**

- Rapthor was traced at
  `b1a64674b1022476cf052fc2d06ee3b16f031ecd` on the
  `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch.
- The local PyBDSF reference was
  `c70103be3ae9ae9908286f144e6ce956acc0ce5c`; the local LSMTool reference was
  `4e5cf93046e309844c04382375f86e68929bd2d8` with two untracked files.
- Rapthor's pinned LSMTool commit
  `3adf3d6f1f8c03db34e13a45a752f6f6dd7d7f4a` was available after refreshing
  the checkout, and its source-finding module matched the checked-out module.
- Rapthor directly consumes `Source_id`, `RA`, `DEC`, `Isl_Total_flux`,
  `Total_flux`, `DC_Maj`, `E_RA`, and `E_DEC`, plus true-sky/flat-noise RMS
  images, the island mask, filtered sky models, and source-count diagnostics.
- `just ci` passed: eight portable tests passed, equivalence and acceptance
  scaffolds skipped as intended, and linting, type checking, strict Marimo and
  MkDocs validation, lockfile validation, and the isolated wheel smoke test
  succeeded.

**Decisions**

- Treat the Rapthor source-finding contract, rather than the complete PyBDSF
  feature set, as Hebog's initial compatibility surface.
- Keep PyBDSF objects and terminology outside Hebog's scientific kernels;
  preserve external names only at a compatibility boundary.
- Treat Rapthor's `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch as the authoritative
  integration target because it owns the Prefect/Dask task runner.
- Keep the revision inventory in candidate status until it records the exact
  installed PyBDSF/LSMTool packages and an immutable built-container digest.

**Deviations and gaps**

- Rapthor declares `bdsf` without a version or revision.
- The refreshed PyBDSF checkout contains changes to island, RMS, and output
  behaviour, so its revision cannot substitute for the still-unknown package
  installed in the benchmark runtime.
- The inspected container definitions use mutable base-image tags; no built
  benchmark-container digest was available.
- The Phase 0 revision-capture task therefore remains open.

**Plan impact**

- Completed the contract inventory, provisional glossary, domain diagrams,
  and ADR 003/004 tasks.
- Kept domain review, frozen examples, contract tests, exact runtime capture,
  comparison oracles, datasets, and baseline reproduction open.

**Next**

- Capture installed package versions and the benchmark-container digest from
  the controlled Rapthor environment.
- Reproduce the representative PyBDSF timings and current matched
  `filter_skymodel` median before implementing the comparison harness.

## 2026-07-18 — Excluded the preliminary scaffold from project evidence

**Plan phase:** Cross-cutting scope clarification

**Completed**

- Removed `ska-sdp-source-finder` from the Phase 0 starting-revision inventory.
- Clarified that the implementation plan is owned by Hebog and must be
  justified against current consumer, dependency, and reference behaviour.

**Decision**

- Do not use the preliminary `ska-sdp-source-finder` scaffold or plan as a
  source of requirements, compatibility evidence, or migration constraints.
- Treat Rapthor's `gec-468-ai-migrate-to-prefect` branch, its pinned LSMTool
  code, and the applicable PyBDSF implementation and runtime as the
  authoritative technical sources.

This clarification supersedes any earlier implication that the preliminary
repository is a continuing project input. Work already adopted into Hebog
must stand on its current tests, documentation, decisions, and authoritative
source evidence.
