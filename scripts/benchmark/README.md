# Benchmark scripts

This directory contains reproducible benchmark entry points for:

- PyBDSF reference runs;
- Hebog using serial, threaded, and Dask executors;
- Rapthor's complete `filter_skymodel` task.

Every result must record the dataset identifier, git revisions, configuration,
Python and dependency versions, worker topology, CPU allocation, wall time,
CPU time, and peak resident memory. Generated results belong in the ignored
`benchmark-results/` directory.

`run_phase0_pybdsf_baseline.py` starts a fresh local Podman container for every
warm-up or measured repetition. Release 1.14.1 uses the PyBDSF already present
in the immutable container. The master campaign installs a separately built
wheel for commit `c70103be3ae9ae9908286f144e6ce956acc0ce5c` into an ephemeral
target directory, preserving every other container dependency.

`pybdsf_reference_run.py` executes the current pinned Rapthor/LSMTool
compatibility path. It records complete wall/CPU/RSS metrics and instruments
the true-sky and flat-noise PyBDSF calls separately. Parent RSS sampling plus
`RUSAGE_SELF`/`RUSAGE_CHILDREN` captures the largest process, not aggregate
concurrent child RSS; the raw result states this limitation. PyBDSF has no
array-copy counter, and these external-process runs do not use Dask, so those
facts are explicit rather than fabricated as measured zeroes.

Materialise the compact frozen input with:

```console
uv run python scripts/validation/materialize_dataset.py \
  config/datasets/phase-0-regression.json \
  pybdsf-compact-reference-256 \
  benchmark-results/phase-0/input/reference-256.fits
```

The baseline driver accepts all repository and input paths explicitly; see
`--help` for the release and master commands. Never point it at a mutable
container tag without checking the digest printed into `baseline-index.json`.
