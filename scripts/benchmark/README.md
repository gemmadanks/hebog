# Benchmark scripts

This directory contains reproducible benchmark entry points for:

- PyBDSF reference runs;
- Hebog using serial, threaded, and Dask executors;
- Rapthor's complete `filter_skymodel` task.

Every result must record the dataset identifier, git revisions, configuration,
Python and dependency versions, worker topology, CPU allocation, wall time,
CPU time, and peak resident memory. Generated results belong in the ignored
`benchmark-results/` directory.

`run_phase0_pybdsf_baseline.py` starts a fresh local Podman container for every
warm-up or measured repetition. Release 1.14.1 uses the PyBDSF already present
in the immutable container. The master campaign installs a separately built
wheel for commit `c70103be3ae9ae9908286f144e6ce956acc0ce5c` into an ephemeral
target directory, preserving every other container dependency.

Build the pinned platform wheel first with
`build_pybdsf_master_wheel.py`. It requires the expected output SHA-256,
rejects a dirty or incorrect checkout, pins the four build helpers, and fails
if the platform artifact differs from the frozen identity. Dependency download
is the only network-requiring step; baseline runs themselves use local inputs
and the built image.

`pybdsf_reference_run.py` executes the current pinned Rapthor/LSMTool
compatibility path. It records complete wall/CPU/RSS metrics and instruments
the true-sky and flat-noise PyBDSF calls separately. Parent RSS sampling plus
`RUSAGE_SELF`/`RUSAGE_CHILDREN` captures the largest process, not aggregate
concurrent child RSS; the raw result states this limitation. PyBDSF has no
array-copy counter, and these external-process runs do not use Dask, so those
facts are explicit rather than fabricated as measured zeroes.

The driver requires explicit detection and island thresholds and clean
checkouts at the pinned Rapthor and LSMTool commits. Both checkouts are mounted
read-only and precede image-installed code. The runner verifies the imported
PyBDSF version and LSMTool module hash, the master wheel, and the exact script
hashes. This prevents a container's stale preinstalled compatibility code from
being labelled with a newer declared revision.

Materialise the compact frozen input with:

```console
uv run python scripts/validation/materialize_dataset.py \
  config/datasets/phase-0-regression.json \
  pybdsf-compact-reference-256 \
  benchmark-results/phase-0/input/reference-256.fits
```

The baseline driver accepts all repository and input paths explicitly; see
`--help` for the release and master commands. Never point it at a mutable
container tag without checking the digest printed into `baseline-index.json`.
It verifies stable scientific products across repetitions. LSMTool sky-model
history timestamps are the only normalized metadata, and the index records
that normalization explicitly. Mutable CASA `table.lock` files are excluded
from Measurement Set identity. `--finalize-existing` revalidates a complete
campaign without rerunning it.

`measure_phase0_overhead.py` measures warm framework overhead with a reused
local thread pool and caller-owned in-process Dask client. It does not include
Dask client startup and labels Phase 0 planning/local results as proxies rather
than production implementations.

`compare_intermediate_stores.py` measures the Phase 1 Zarr v3 local-store
prototype against the NumPy-file oracle with matched generated data, tile
geometry, warm-up policy, and repetitions. It writes one versioned
`BenchmarkEvidence` document per implementation beneath the ignored output
directory. For example:

```console
uv run python scripts/benchmark/compare_intermediate_stores.py \
  benchmark-results/phase1-zarr-prototype \
  --height 1024 --width 1024 \
  --chunk-height 256 --chunk-width 256 \
  --warmups 1 --repetitions 5 --seed 20260731
```

This is a local exploratory component probe, not the distributed, direct-FITS,
or Rapthor end-to-end qualification required for a performance claim.
